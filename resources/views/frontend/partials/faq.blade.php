                                        According to traditional publishing, you must submit your work and have it
                                        accepted before it can be published. With this type of publishing, there are no
                                        costs.
                                        While publishers may accept unrequested manuscripts from authors, they
                                        frequently discover works through literary agencies. Publishing houses pay for
                                        the creation, editing, and marketing of books. On occasion, they even grant
                                        authors advances when they sign book deals. Based on the sales of their books,
                                        authors get paid a royalty (7–12% of the cover price for debut authors).
                                        Publishers only accept a small number of novels because they are willing to
                                        assume the financial risk before the book generates any sales. Most publishing
                                        houses receive tons of unsolicited manuscripts regularly, so A successful writer
                                        needs a lot of willpower, diligence, good fortune, and tenacity.
                                        By self-publishing, you can control some or all of the other steps in the book
                                        publishing process, including editing, cover design, marketing, and production.
                                        You pay to have your work published. Your job is regarded as self-published if
                                        you spend a charge to have it published.

                                        The term "print on demand" (POD) is frequently used to refer to the digital
                                        printing technology that makes it possible to print and bind an entire book in
                                        minutes. Instead of producing books in more significant print runs of several
                                        hundred or thousands, digital printing makes it simple and affordable to publish
                                        books one or two at a time or in small batches.

                                        SUBSIDY PRESS: This refers to a publishing model where the publisher assigns the
                                        book an ISBN and then charges the author a fee for publishing the book. The
                                        publisher and distributors/sellers the publisher arranges typically give the
                                        author a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of the books.
